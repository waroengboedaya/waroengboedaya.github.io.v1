*Dashboard to visualise the berthing times in relation to berths location, ship types, and weather.*

###Background
Singapore has one of the busiest port in the world, handling over 60,000 containers and 500 million tonnes of cargo every year and its maritime industry has contributed to approximately 7% per cent of the countryâ€™s GDP. As international competition intensifies, Singapore will need to incorporate state-of-the-art technologies to make sense of the port activities and enable greater efficiencies and productivity in sustainable way. 

###Challenge Statement
Maritime Port Authority (MPA) supported by various maritime industry players such as PSA, Jurong Port and Singapore Shipping Association (SSA) organized Smart Port hackathon to explore new, innovative use of technology to address following key challenges:
  
  * Productivity
  * Efficiency
  * Sustainability

The proposed solution should enhance the productivity and drive improved operational efficiency of those who manage port operations by providing them with the right blend of knowledge, skills and technology-enabled tools. It also provides assistance in managing complex processes to identify and reduce risk areas and mitigate impacts on the rest of the ecosystem within a sustainability framework that recognises and minimises the impact on the environment. 

###Idea
During hackathon, the organizer has made available significant range and amount of datasets to enable the community to conceptualize innovative services and solutions to the maritime industry. We noticed the difficulty learning to interpret and understand these large amount of data and decided to develop interactive dashboard for Port Operation Manager to easily visualize, analyze and identify factors as well as areas of improvement, particularly the berth and vessel operations.
